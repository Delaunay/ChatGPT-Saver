# ChatGPT-Saver
Created by Jeanmarco Allain

This Firefox add-on allows you to select how you wish to save a ChatGPT conversation. You may save as an HTML file or as a text file.

Download the add-on for Firefox here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chatgpt-saver/

I invite anyone to make this work on Chrome.
